This is a project made for university. The project had to involve the following topics:

1. Create an API with NodeJs and express in the Back-end
2. Use Vue in the Front-end
3. Use an arduino and any type of sensor
4. Run unity tests
5. Implement PWA and service workers

Keep in mind this project was developed in cloud9, which basically means all the routes and such don't work, as of now. We'll try our best to fix this, but it's quite a long process.
